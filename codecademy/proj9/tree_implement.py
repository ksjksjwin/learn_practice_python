"""
- Trees are a Python class called TreeNode.
- A TreeNode has two properties, value and children.
- Nodes hold any type of data inside value.
- children is a list, which can be empty or hold other instances of TreeNode.
- We add to children by using the list method .append.
- We remove from children by filtering the list.
