1. A class is a template for a data type. It describes the kinds of information that class will hold and how a programmer will interact with that data
2. A class instance is also called an object. The pattern of defining classes and creating objects to represent the responsibilities of a program is known as Object Oriented Programming or OOP.

Instantiation takes a class and turns it into an object, the type() function does the opposite of that. When called with an object, it returns the class that the object is an instance of.

print(type(cool_instance))
# prints "<class '__main__.CoolClass'>"
We then print out the type() of cool_instance and it shows us that this object is of type __main__.CoolClass.

In Python __main__ means "this current file that we're running" and so one could read the output from type() to mean "the class CoolClass that was defined here, in the script you're currently running."

3. A class variable is a variable that's the same for every instance of the class. You can define a class variable by including it in the indented part of your class definition, and you can access all of an object's class variables with object.variable syntax.
4. Methods are functions that are defined as part of a class.
5. Methods that are used to prepare an object being instantiated are called constructors. The word "constructor" is used to describe similar features in other object-oriented programming languages but programmers who refer to a constructor in Python are usually talking about the __init__ method.
6. class is a schematic for a data type and an object is an instance of a class
7. The data held by an object is referred to as an instance variable. Instance variables aren't shared by all instances of a class â€” they are variables that are specific to the object they are attached to
8. hasattr(attributeless, "fake_attribute")

# returns False

getattr(attributeless, "other_fake_attribute", 800)
# returns 800, the default value

9. When two classes have the same method names and attributes, we say they implement the same interface. An interface in Python usually refers to the names of the methods and the arguments they take. 
10.  Polymorphism is the term used to describe the same syntax (like the + operator here, but it could be a method name) doing different actions depending on the type of data.
