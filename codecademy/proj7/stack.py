"""
Stacks:
1.Contain data nodes
2.Support three main operations
  -Push adds data to the top of the stack
  -Pop removes and provides data from the top of the stack
  -Peek reveals data on the top of the stack
3.Implementations include a linked list or array
4.Can have a limited size
  -Pushing data onto a full stack results in a stack overflow
5.Stacks process data Last In, First Out (LIFO)
