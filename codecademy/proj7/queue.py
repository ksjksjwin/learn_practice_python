"""
Queues:

1. Contain data nodes
2. Support three main operations:
   - Enqueue adds data to the back of the queue
   - Dequeue removes and provides data from the front of the queue
   - Peek provides data on the front of the queue
4. Can be implemented using a linked list or array
5. Bounded queues have a limited size.
6. Enqueueing onto a full queue causes a queue overflow
7. Queues process data First In, First Out (FIFO)
